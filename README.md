# Savings Checker

## Description
The Savings Checker smart contract helps users build better financial habits by rewarding them for logging their savings activities. Users input a date and description of a savings milestone or expense, and upon successful submission, they earn points. These points can be collected and redeemed for rewards, encouraging consistent financial discipline.
For this project, write a smart contract that implements the require(), assert() and revert() statements.

Upload your solution to GitHub and share the link with us along with a quick code walk-through as explained below.

### Functions
- **dateInput**: You will need to input date and description(amount).
- **successfulInput**: Once you inputed it correctly you will receive a point.
- **redeem**: Redeem points when you earn points

#### Getting Started
1. To execute this you will need Remix. https://remix.ethereum.org/

2. Copy the code then paste it on remix! viola! (Remember to put .sol at the end)

Other notes: 
The code does not work on my end with pragma 0.8.18, I used pragma  0.8.26.

I also used Remix instead of Gitpod since it is not working on my end.
